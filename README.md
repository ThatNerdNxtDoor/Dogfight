This is the final project for CSC 316 - 3D Game Engine Design made in collaboration by Isaiah Thompson (Lead Programmer) and Mitchell Playforth (Modeller and Programmer) in C#. This project is a simple 3D game in which the player is a spaceship flying around and shooting down incoming enemy ships that fly towards and shoot at the player.
